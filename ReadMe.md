# Main Goal
Here i will share my process of learning and getting a grasp of computer systems. First gain the needed knowledge about how general computer systems and Operating systems works.
Second I venture into Windows architecture(windows internals), Linux architecture, and lastly MacOS architecture. Why? For to understand how to be able to cyberattack something, we need to understand how it works,
how it is secured, how the people interact with it. Understanding the fundamentals of a concepts is the key for learning anything and become great at it.

# Notes
I started learning about this topic before i made this github acc, regardless i will share what my progress here as if i just have started.

# Prerequisites  
Usually, to the only prerequisite that one may need if he is starting to learn about computer systems from 0 is only a strong understanding of basic mathematic concepts such as:

Algebra:

    Solving linear and quadratic equations
    Graphing linear and quadratic functions
    Manipulating algebraic expressions
    Understanding the properties of real numbers

Boolean Logic:

    Understanding the basic concepts of Boolean algebra, including AND, OR, and NOT operations
    Understanding the laws of Boolean algebra, including the distributive, associative, and commutative laws
    Understanding the use of truth tables to evaluate Boolean expressions

Discrete Mathematics:

    Understanding the basic concepts of sets, relations, and functions
    Understanding the principles of counting, including permutations and combinations
    Understanding the basics of graph theory, including graph representation and graph algorithms

Knowing programming language syntax (preferably C/C++) would help a lot but is not quite necessary at first. Later on learning Assembly would help too.
As i progress further i will understand more hard concepts such as Virtualization, Concurrency, Persistence(Three Easy Pieces, IYKYK)

# Books_Currently_Reading
> Operating Systems, Three Easy Pieces ---> On_Halt (i am at chapter 7: Intro to Scheduling; While i can continue reading  not facing difficulties in understanding the concepts, rather my problems is with the low   level c programs, i learned c but not to experienced in low level programming, so i decided to put a halt  on this advanced book and go back to a more beginner friendly book)

> Yale Patt, Sanjay Patel - Introduction to Computing Systems_ From Bits & Gates to C_C++ & Beyond (2019, McGraw-Hill Education) ---> OnGoing (should've started here this book is quite rich in info)
