# Chapter 1: Welcome Abroad

1. Explain the first of the two important ideas stated in Section 1.5.

    The Two important notions are the notion of abstraction and the notion of hardware vs. software

    The notion of abstraction is the ideology that whilst working on something we should not be so taken away by the details so that it hinders our actual progress, neither should we be in a state where we can't go back to check and understand details. To achieve anything in life, we go through steps. Of course each step is made from multiple smaller steps. The idea of abstraction is that while in a single step we know for sure how each of the smaller steps work and they are set and unlikely to change, we don't have to waste time and energy to check and go into each smaller step we can immediately finish the step as it is and move on to the next one. On the other hand, it is important that we know what are the smaller steps and how they work, not having the need to go through them does not mean we should not know what they are. For it happens sometime we need to attentively deconstruct a step into as many steps as needed so we can meet the wanted result. And to do that we should have the appropriate knowledge to know how to properly use each step to meet the wanted results. Abstraction and Deconstruction  is a notion that cover all the aspect of life not only computers.

    The notion of hardware versus software is one that preaches to treat hardware and software as one rather than treating each as if it is its own special domain. This notion is pretty clear. To achieve higher levels of intellect we should treat our learning of these to concepts as essential to one another. It is self explanatory kinda if one knows how computer resources work, one will ofc be able to write much better programs.

2. Can a higher-level programming language instruct a computer to compute more than a lower-level programming language?
